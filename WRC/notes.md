## Current Problem
* https://github.com/avrora/meteor-gMaps/blob/master/meteorAndGmaps.js for using directions with google maps

* where is Sans Pro font set from

=> Started proxy.
=> A patch (Meteor 1.0.3.2) for your current release is available!
   Update this project now with 'meteor update --patch'.
   Loading plugin `initializing-npm-supp...  |

-> creating `packages.json` for the first time.
-> add your npm modules to `packages.json`

=> Creating container package for npm modules

-> npm support has been initialized.
-> please start your app again.


* You've set up some data subscriptions with Meteor.publish(), but
 ** you still have autopublish turned on. Because autopublish is still
** on, your Meteor.publish() calls won't have much effect. All data
** will still be sent to all clients.
**
** Turn off autopublish by removing the autopublish package:
**
**   $ meteor remove autopublish
 **
** .. and make sure you have Meteor.publish() and Meteor.subscribe() calls
** for each collection that you want clients to see.



* more feedback from the boys
* figure why bootstrap/less doesn't do exactly what we want all the time
  * e.g. integrating external fonts

## grids
* how to implement grids?
  * make container or container-fluid
    * container has discrete increments
      * what are these?
  * make row
  * make columns with with different classes
    * grid-md-4 -> medium size  (laptop)  4 of 12 columns

## DNS etc

To get hosting with meteor.com I:
* from command line: "meteor deploy wrconnections.com"
* on godaddy: I changed the A record in the nameserver record to point to from "@" (which represents the current domain name) to the ip address of "original.meteor.com"
  * the ip address was found using some website I googled using "ip address"

## Fonts
* got google fonts loaded uses javascript inserted into lib directory (it gets loaded first)
* then realized that heading fonts can be set like everything else..
  * they were initially "inherit"
  * I could probably set the parent element easier... not sure where to do this
  though

## What Nik and Jon have done
*  got a logo
*  and cards
*  and invoice

## What they are going to do:
*    hiring 2nd
*    request rate
*    get quotes
*    contact info
*    mobile site
*    QR codes

    not a slick
    clean cri

    priority quality
    technology -> savings
