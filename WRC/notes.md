# WRC Notes

## DNS etc

To get hosting with meteor.com I:
* from command line: "meteor deploy wrconnections.com"
* on godaddy: I changed the A record in the nameserver record to point to from "@" (which represents the current domain name) to the ip address of "original.meteor.com"
  * the ip address was found using some website I googled using "ip address"

## What Nik and Jon have done
*  got a logo
*  and cards
*  and invoice

## What they are going to do:
*    hiring 2nd
*    request rate
*    get quotes
*    contact info
*    mobile site
*    QR codes

    not a slick
    clean cri
